    <h2>Bridging Analytics and Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my <strong>Business Analytics Portfolio</strong> — a curated collection of projects that highlight my ability to transform data into strategic business insights. Each project reflects my technical proficiency, analytical thinking, and dedication to solving real-world business challenges with purpose and precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a results-driven <strong>Business Analyst</strong> with a strong foundation in healthcare operations management and a deep commitment to integrity, trust, and people-first decision-making. Skilled in SQL, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel, I’ve earned the <strong>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</strong> through Merit America, gaining hands-on experience transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive meaningful results.
    </p>

    <p>
      What sets me apart is my ability to combine data-driven strategy with genuine human understanding. My background in healthcare operations taught me that every metric represents people—clients, employees, and outcomes that truly matter. That perspective fuels my approach to analytics as not just a technical discipline, but a way to empower others, improve processes, and create lasting impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally curious and highly analytical, I thrive on uncovering patterns, asking questions, and finding creative solutions to complex problems. Whether developing visual dashboards, refining reporting systems, or helping leadership make data-informed decisions, I focus on delivering work that blends precision, clarity, and purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Above all, I believe in doing the right thing—even when it’s not the easiest path. I bring calm, structure, and integrity to high-pressure situations, and I’m passionate about helping teams use data to make confident, informed choices. My goal is to partner with a forward-thinking organization where curiosity, collaboration, and empathy drive meaningful change.
